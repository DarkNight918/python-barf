# BARF Project

So far the *BARF Project* is composed of the following packages:

* **BARF** : A multiplatform open source Binary Analysis and Reverse engineering Framework
* **BARFgadgets** : A tool built upon BARF that lets you *search*, *classifiy* and *verify* ROP gadgets inside a binary program.
* **PyAsmJIT** : A JIT for the Intel x86_64 architecture.

All packages were tested on Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04 (x86_64).
